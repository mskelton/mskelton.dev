This past week, I began my new position at [Widen](https://www.widen.com/) as a
staff software engineer with a focus on JavaScript engineering and developer
experience. As I reflected on my career journey and what I learned to make it to
this point, I wanted to share my journey and learnings to help other developers
advance their careers and become better software engineers. In this article,

spent as a software engineer.
