I'm a JavaScript engineer and lead developer working at
[Widen](https://www.widen.com). While I'm not afraid of CSS, my true passion
lies in JavaScript engineering and developer experience (DX). I love finding
ways to simplify or improve development workflow to save time and make it more
fun to work on applications. Wait, did I forget to mention how much I love
TypeScript?

Outside of work, I'm a small town kid from Wisconsin who loves small town life
almost as much as I like snow and winter. In my free time I like working on my
house, spending time with my girlfriend, and playing disc golf. I am also a
devout Christian seeking to be more like Jesus in word, thought, and deed.

While I am a software engineer and a total nerd, I'm a huge extrovert and love
spending time with people. If you ever want to debate the usefulness of college
education for professions like computer science, I will gladly oblige as I am a
self-taught developer who found very little practical value in college behind
getting that slip of paper they call a diploma.
