I'm a software developer and follower of Christ from Monroe, Wisconsin. Right
now, I'm working at [Widen](https://www.widen.com) as a lead developer and
JavaScript Engineer. TypeScript and React are my jam, plus a host of other
technologies including Node, Playwright, webpack, Prettier, ESLint, and much
more.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with friends, playing disc golf, coding
(why not), and remodeling my house. I'm both an extrovert and a nerd, so I'm
more than happy to talk for long periods of time with my family about tech, even
if they donâ€™t understand. ðŸ˜‚
