I'm a software developer and follower of Christ from Monroe, Wisconsin. Right
now, I'm working at [Nextiva](https://www.nextiva.com) as a Senior Software
Engineer. TypeScript and React are my jam, plus a host of other technologies
including Node, Playwright, webpack, Prettier, ESLint, and much more.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with friends, playing disc golf, coding
(why not), and remodeling my house. I'm both an extrovert and a nerd, so I'm
more than happy to talk for long periods of time with my family about tech, even
if they donâ€™t understand. ðŸ˜‚
