title: Why I Use The Fish Shell

The [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com) is not the most popular shell by any
means. While it does make the top three, it's usage is still significantly lower
than the big two: bash and zsh. However, for the right person, Fish is a
fantastic choice for a shell with lots of nice improvements that make working in
the terminal a pleasure. Let's talk through some of my favorite features, as
well as some of the pain points and criticisms I have for Fish.

## Autocompletion

While other shells have autocompletion support with the right set of plugins or
configuration, Fish includes it out of the box and it works very well. Not only
can you cycle through candidate options when pressing `<Tab>`, but it also gives
you predictive suggestions as you type based on your shell history, making it
dead simple to execute commands repeatedly.

Let's see a few examples!

Fish has a huge library of completions for common tools and many tools these
days that provided completion generation commands (e.g. `gh completion`) support
Fish completions.

## Vim mode

For non-Vim users this one isn't that big of a deal, but for me it's a game
changer. Fish has the ability to configure Vim style keyboard shortcuts to turn
your terminal into a mini version of Vim, allowing you to switch between insert
and normal mode, making it super simple to move around and edit a command you
are working on. Also, it's all just keybindings so you can even customizing it
yourself with your own keybindings for specific modes. Here are a few of my
favorites:
