  applications. In this article, I show a few small CSS customizations to
  improve the npmjs.com styles.

Like most front-end developers, I use [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) to find new
packages or read documentation for packages I use. I've also published some npm
packages of my own, giving back to the open-source community.

As I have used [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) more in the past few months, a
couple of the styles used on the package view page were just bugging me as they
gave the page an unfinished and poorly styled look. So, with the help of the
Chrome Stylus extension I was able to add a couple quick styles to get the page
looking nice. The before and after of the page are shown below.

Here is the code I used for this simple style adjustment.

```css
blockquote > p {
  margin: 5px 0 !important;
}

table {
  border-bottom: none !important;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}
```
