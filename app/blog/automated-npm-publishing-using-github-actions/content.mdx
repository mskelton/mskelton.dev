title: Automated npm Publishing Using GitHub Actions
description:
  Releasing npm packages can be a challenge. There are often many steps in the
  process and forgetting a step can result in a package being released
  incorrectly. In this article, I will show how to use GitHub Actions to
  automate some of the manual steps required to simplify your npm publishing
  workflow.

GitHub Actions are a great way to setup CI/CD tasks directly in your GitHub
repos for running tests, deploying code, publishing packages, and so much more.
I've recently done some work to setup actions in my open source repositories for
easily publishing npm packages without forcing me to run a bunch of commands
from my local development machine. In this article, I'll go through some basic
jobs that you can run using GitHub Actions to simplify the process of publishing
npm packages.

## Basic Publish Action

To get our feet wet with publishing npm packages using GitHub Actions, let's
start by creating a simple action that will publish to npm when we push a new
version tag.

```yaml .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Publish
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v*.*.*
jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "16.x"
          registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

This action is pretty basic and easy to understand. For the trigger, we use the
tag pattern of `v*.*.*` to match semantic version tags (i.e. v1.0.0). When the
action is triggered, we install dependencies by running `yarn` and then publish
the package to npm using `yarn publish`. This could be modified to use
`npm install` and `npm publish` if you prefer npm over Yarn.

An important part of this action is the `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable
which is required for authenticating with npm to publish the package. The
example above uses GitHub secrets for storing the token which can be generated
in your npm profile.

## Publishing A Release

To publish a release with our new action, we can run `yarn publish` or
`npm publish` to increment the package version in package.json and create a new
git tag which we will use to trigger our action. After running the publish
command, we can run `git push && git push --tags` to push our tag to GitHub and
fire off our action!

_Hint: adding a `postversion` script to package.json will save us from having to
run the git push command every time we run our publish command. That script
would look like this `"postversion": "git push && git push --tags"` and should
be places in the `scripts` section of your package.json_

## Creating GitHub Releases

Now that we have the basic publish action created, we can improve it so it will
automatically create a GitHub release with change notes pulled automatically
from a `CHANGELOG.md` file. To make this easy, we will be using a custom GitHub
action by [Roang-zero1](https://github.com/Roang-zero1) that will automate this
entire process for us. To set this up, add the following job to your action.

```yaml .github/workflows/publish.yml
create-release:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: Roang-zero1/github-create-release-action@master
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

As you can see, the only thing we need to do is use the
`github-create-release-action` and set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
so the custom action can authenticate with GitHub to create the release and
upload the change notes. The value of this is the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret that is
[automatically available inside all GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).

## Running Tests

While the above examples work great for simple packages where you just need to
publish and create a release, most packages will probably have a suite of tests
that you will want to run before publishing and releasing. To update our action,
we are going to need to make a few changes.

First, we will need to change the action trigger from on tags to on push. This
way we can use the same action to run our tests on branches and pull requests.
The trigger should now look like this.

```yaml .github/workflows/publish.yml
on: [push]
```

Next, we will add a `test` job to the action that uses a matrix strategy to test
our package against multiple node versions. You could also add OS versions to
the matrix but for our example we'll keep it simple.

```yaml .github/workflows/publish.yml
test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  strategy:
    matrix:
      node-version: [10.x, 12.x]
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: yarn
    - run: yarn test
```

The last step is to update our other two jobs to depend on the test job and only
run on tags. By depending on the test job we can ensure that we don't publish a
package until the tests have run and passed. Additionally, since we changed our
trigger from tags to any push, we need to add a conditional to ensure that the
publish and release steps will only run for tags while the test can still run
for any push. We will need to add the following two lines to both the publish
and release jobs.

```yaml .github/workflows/publish.yml
needs: test
if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
```

## Putting It All together

Putting all three of these pieces together, our final action would look like
this. In some cases, you may not need all three of the jobs so you can easily
mix and match to suit you needs.

```yaml .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Test, Publish, & Release
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn test
  publish:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "16.x"
          registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
  create-release:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: Roang-zero1/github-create-release-action@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Bonus: GitHub Actions Badge

Once you get your actions working, you may wish to add a status badge to your
readme to show if the build is passing or failing. GitHub Actions have builtin
support for this which you can read more about on their
[official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions#adding-a-workflow-status-badge-to-your-repository).
