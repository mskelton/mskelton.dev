title: "Semicolons: The Never Ending Debate"
description:
  The JavaScript community loves to debate about semicolons thanks to
  JavaScript's ability to use them or not. In this article, I give some thoughts
  on the two camps in this debate as well as what I believe to be a more
  reasonable approach to this debate.

Ah, semicolons. The long debated topic in the JavaScript community that is
almost as bad as the debate between tabs and spaces. For those who are somehow
blissfully unaware of the main camps in this debate, let me summarize.

## The semicolon camp

The semicolon camp is made up of those who believe that semicolons should always
be used in JavaScript, regardless of if they are needed. The arguments from
those in this camp typically tend to revolve around preventing a category of
bugs that can occur with
[automatic semicolon insertion (ASI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#automatic_semicolon_insertion).
Additionally, I've noticed that tooling authors tend to favor explicit
semicolons as ASI is more difficult to manage as the compiler has more rules it
has to understand regarding when a statement ends rather than simply finding the
semicolon and calling it a day.

## The anti-semicolon camp

This camp is made up of people who tend to argue about this topic stylistically,
such as "semicolons look worse", or perhaps argue that they require more typing.
In my experience hearing arguments from those in this camp, they tend to be
quite weak and extremely subjective as opposed to the much more concrete reasons
given by the semicolon camp.

## Where I stand on the issue

Reading my last sentence, you may think that I fit in the semicolon, but don't
jump to conclusions to quickly. My thoughts on this subject are more complex
than just that.

First, I do believe that those in the semicolon camp do have good points to be
made about correctness and bug prevention by enforcing semicolon use. I mean,
does any engineer want more bugs? Additionally, I think that those in both camps
forget something quite important to this debate: auto-fixing.

For those that don't want to take the extra effort to type semicolons, simply
let a tool like [Prettier](https://prettier.io) do it for you. Likewise, for
those in the semicolon camp, Prettier will just as easily add semicolons to
places in your code that could result in bugs from incorrect ASI. So to both
camps, I think these arguments aren't valid.

As for readability and code "beauty", I think that saying that semicolons make
your code look worse is totally not what the anti-semicolon camp should be
arguing for. There is a much more tangible reason why you might want to not use
semicolons which is method chaining or wrapping. If you have a chain of array
methods and want to add another, if you don't have semicolons you can simply add
a new line below the last line of the chain and start typing, no need to remove
the semicolon on the previous line.

```javascript
const foo = bar.filter(...)
  .map(...);
  .reduce(...) // Oops! Forgot to remove the semicolon on the last line!
```

Another example is when wrapping a statement in a function call, such as
`console.log` (we can talk about `console.log` vs debuggers later).

```javascript
const foo = console.log(doWork();) // Oops! Wrapped to much!
```

## What's my point?

So, why even bring this whole debate up? My hope is that both sides of this
argument will use good arguments since both sides can actually have good reasons
for why they chose a particular style. While I prefer to let Prettier to add
semicolons in the few places where I need them but leave them out the rest of
the time, I totally respect those who enforce semicolons.

Cheers, y'all!
