The JavaScript ecosystem is fast paced and continuously changing. By the time
you finish adopting some fancy new library, another library has come along with
people telling you to drop everything and adopt it. Even if you pick a library
and stick with it, breaking changes happen from time to time, which add great
new features but sometimes mean a long or painful refactor.

As a developer, there are a few ways of dealing with this problem. The first
approach would be to never update your libraries so you don't have to spend time
on updates. While this might save you some time, it also means you won't be
getting security updates or access to new features that could save time in other
ways. Another approach would be to always update your libraries to the latest
versions soon after they come out. While this is better than the previous
approach, it also means you will be spending a lot of extra time refactoring
your applications.

In this article, I'll discuss a third approach, which uses a tool called
jscodeshift to automate code transformation to speed up refactoring so you can
take advantage of new libraries or updates without having to manually migrate
your project(s).

You can find the code from this article, as well as an example Jest test suite,
in the
[accompanying GitHub repo](https://github.com/mskelton/jscodeshift-example).

## Introduction to jscodeshift

[jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) is a tool created by
Facebook that provides a simple API to perform abstract syntax tree (AST)
transformations on your project's source files. We can use these APIs to create
custom “codemods” to transform our code for whatever needs we have. An example
of this might be removing an imported variable from a library and instead
importing it from a file in your project. The code block below demonstrates this
example, which I'll use for the remainder of this article.

```javascript
// Input
import { useQuery, queryCache } from "react-query"

// Output
import { useQuery } from "react-query"
import { queryClient as queryCache } from "common/queryClient"
```

## Getting started with jscodeshift

Hopefully, by now, you have an idea of the purpose of jscodeshift, so let's dive
in and write an example codemod from scratch to solve the use case I showed in
the last code block.

First, we need to install jscodeshift.

```bash
npm install -g jscodeshift
```

This will install jscodeshift globally so we can run it for any project. Next,
let's create a file called `transform.js` with the following boilerplate for our
codemod.

```javascript transform.js
module.exports = function (fileInfo, api) {
  const j = api.jscodeshift
  const source = j(fileInfo.source)

  // Your transformations go here

  return source.toSource()
}
```

You don't need to understand this boilerplate in great depth, but a quick
explanation of its purpose doesn't hurt. jscodeshift expects that transform
scripts export a function that will accept two arguments with the file
information and the jscodeshift API. We can then call the `api.jscodeshift`
method (which we alias as `j`), passing it the input file source code. Our
transformations would be the next step of the codemod, but for now we won't do
anything. Finally, we'll call `toSource()`, which will convert the transformed
AST back into a string, which jscodeshift will write back to the input file.

If any of that was confusing, don't worry. This boilerplate is pretty much the
same for all codemods, so the important part to learn is the actual code
transformation portion.

## Applying transformations

When writing codemods, it's often best to break up the problem into each part
and then tackle each part separately. This is especially helpful when writing a
large codemod with lots of steps and options. For this codemod, there are two
steps we need to take:

1. Remove the `queryCache` variable from the `react-query` import, if it exists.
1. If `queryCache` was imported, add a new import declaration to import it from
   the new location.

We'll start with step 1, but first let's do a quick review of the AST for our
example file. Below is a rough outline of the AST, which shows that our file has
an `ImportDeclaration` node that contains two `ImportSpecifier` nodes. Each
{"import"} specifier has an `imported` name and a `local` name that will be
important for step 2.

```
- ImportDeclaration:
  - source
    - Literal
      - value: react-query
  - specifiers [2]
    - ImportSpecifier
      - imported
        - Identifier
          - name: useQuery
      - local
        - Identifier
          - name: useQuery
    - ImportSpecifier
      - imported
        - Identifier
          - name: queryCache
      - local
        - Identifier
          - name: queryCache
```

_To see the AST of the source code in your project(s), check out
[AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net) which provides a fantastic AST
visualizer._

## Removing the `queryCache` variable

Now that we know what our AST looks like, we can get down to business writing
our transformation. To remove the `queryCache` import specifier from the
`react-query` import, use the jscodeshift `find`, `filter`, and `remove` methods
using the following three steps.

1. Find all the import specifiers in the file.
1. Filter to just the `queryCache` import specifier from the `react-query`
   import.
1. Remove the `queryCache` import specifier.

This would look like this in our `transform.js` file.

```javascript
// Your transformations go here
source
  .find(j.ImportSpecifier)
  .filter((path) => path.parent.value.source.value === "react-query")
  .filter((path) => path.value.imported.name === "queryCache")
  .remove()
```

## Testing our first change

Before we move on, let's test our change to verify it's correctly removing the
`queryCache` variable. To do this, create a file called `test.js` and add the
following content:

```javascript
import { useQuery, queryCache } from "react-query"
```

Next, transform the file using the following shell command:

```bash
jscodeshift -t transform.js test.js
```

After running that command, we should see that `test.js` has changed to the
following:

```javascript
import { useQuery } from "react-query"
```

Awesome! We've now successfully completed the first step of removing the
`queryCache` variable from the react-query import. Now, let's move on to step 2.

## Adding the new import

To add the new import, we first need to track if we removed a queryCache
variable from the `react-query` import. Do this by checking the `length`
property of the collection returned from our code in step 1.

```javascript
const specifiers = source
  .find(j.ImportSpecifier)
  .filter((path) => path.parent.value.source.value === "react-query")
  .filter((path) => path.value.imported.name === "queryCache")
  .remove()

if (specifiers.length) {
  // Add new import
}
```

Next, we need to find the `react-query` import so we can insert our new import
after it. This logic will look very similar to our logic in step 1 where we
found the import specifier.

```javascript
// Add new import
source
  .find(j.ImportDeclaration)
  .filter((path) => path.value.source.value === "react-query")
```

Finally, we can call the `insertAfter` function to insert our new import after
the existing `react-query` import. The value that we pass to `insertAfter` can
be any valid AST node, which we can easily create thanks to the helper functions
provided by jscodeshift.

```javascript
source
  .find(j.ImportDeclaration)
  .filter((path) => path.value.source.value === "react-query")
  .insertAfter(
    j.importDeclaration(
      [
        j.importSpecifier(
          j.identifier("queryClient"),
          j.identifier("queryCache")
        ),
      ],
      j.stringLiteral("common/queryClient")
    )
  )
```

_When creating new AST nodes, using AST Explorer helps to understand the shape
of nodes so you can more easily create them using the jscodeshift helper
methods._

## Putting it all together

If we put all of this together, our final file should look something like this:

```javascript
module.exports = function (file, api) {
  const j = api.jscodeshift
  const source = j(file.source)

  const specifiers = source
    .find(j.ImportSpecifier)
    .filter((path) => path.parent.value.source.value === "react-query")
    .filter((path) => path.value.imported.name === "queryCache")
    .remove()

  if (specifiers.length) {
    source
      .find(j.ImportDeclaration)
      .filter((path) => path.value.source.value === "react-query")
      .insertAfter(
        j.importDeclaration(
          [
            j.importSpecifier(
              j.identifier("queryClient"),
              j.identifier("queryCache")
            ),
          ],
          j.stringLiteral("common/queryClient")
        )
      )
  }

  return source.toSource()
}
```

Congratulations! We've just created our first codemod using jscodeshift!

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored how to use jscodeshift to automate code
transformations to simplify refactors. While the example I showed might not be
useful to you, it should give you an idea of what you can do with jscodeshift.
If you want to see a more complex codemod, check out
[Ratchet](https://github.com/mskelton/ratchet), a project I created that
automatically converts React PropTypes to TypeScript definitions.

## Bonus: Type definitions

Since remembering all the available jscodeshift methods is not easy, jscodeshift
provides type definitions out of the box! All you have to do is add a JSDoc
comment to specify the types of the parameters and your editor will now
autocomplete the available methods!

```javascript
/**
 * @param {import('jscodeshift').FileInfo} fileInfo
 * @param {import('jscodeshift').API} api
 */
module.exports = function (fileInfo, api) {}
```
