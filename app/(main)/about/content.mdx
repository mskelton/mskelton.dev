I'm a staff software engineer working at [Ramp](https://ramp.com). I love
all things frontend whether that's building stunning UI components,
improving accessibility and user experience, or fine-tuning the frontend
build system. Developer experience is another huge passion of mine as I
like to empower myself and other engineers to build excellent solutions
with less friction. TypeScript, React, CSS, and Go are where you'll find me
the happiest, and a little Rust sprinkled here and there doesn't hurt.

Outside of work, I'm a Wisconsin native who loves small-town life almost as
much as I like snow and winter. In my free time, I like working on my
house, spending time with my fianc√©e, and playing disc golf. My life is
dedicated to the service of Jesus and sharing the good news of the gospel
to the ends of the earth. My hope is for men and women to find in Jesus the
only true hope for this life, and the life to come.
