title: Why I Use The Fish Shell
description:
  While Bash and Zsh are the leading shells used by developers, I find the Fish
  shell to be a great fit for my workflow as it provides a great experience with
  nice features and improvments to my daily workflow. Read on to learn about my
  favorite features as well as some things I wish were changed in Fish.

The [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com) is not the most popular shell by any
means. While it does make the top three, it's usage is still significantly lower
than the big two: bash and zsh. However, for the right person, Fish is a
fantastic choice for a shell with lots of nice improvements that make working in
the terminal a pleasure. Let's talk through some of my favorite features, as
well as some of the pain points and criticisms I have for Fish.

## Autocompletion

While other shells have autocompletion support with the right set of plugins or
configuration, Fish includes it out of the box and it works very well. Not only
can you cycle through candidate options when pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>, but it
also gives you predictive suggestions as you type based on your shell history,
making it dead simple to execute commands repeatedly.

Let's see a few examples!

Fish has a huge library of completions for common tools and many tools these
days that provided completion generation commands (e.g. `gh completion`) support
Fish completions.

## Vim mode

For non-Vim users this one isn't that big of a deal, but for me it's a game
changer. Fish has the ability to configure Vim style keyboard shortcuts to turn
your terminal into a mini version of Vim, allowing you to switch between insert
and normal mode, making it super simple to move around and edit a command you
are working on. Also, it's all just keybindings so you can even customizing it
yourself with your own keybindings for specific modes. Here are a few of my
favorites:

```bash
# Use _ to go to the beginning of the line as I use this a lot in Vim
bind -s --preset _ beginning-of-line
bind -s --preset -M visual _ beginning-of-line

# Switch between modes with escape. A little out of the ordinary, but I find
# myself doing it a lot. Also updates escape in insert mode to not move
# backwards one character.
bind -s --preset \e "set fish_bind_mode insert; commandline -f repaint-mode"
```

## Syntax highlighting

Another feature that I love about Fish is command syntax highlighting. Not
because it makes the output in my terminal more pretty, but rather because it
helps me catch mistakes more easily. When the color of a file path or command
changes from red to blue, I know I'm typing a valid command, helping me catch
mistakes early before running the command. Also, having commands, arguments, and
strings distinguished with different colors does help when scanning through
terminal history to quickly understand a command that was run.

## The bad parts

One of the big selling points of fish I have yet to talk about, and that is the
scripting language. The reason I waited to mention it is that I don't actually
think it's a selling point of Fish. Let me explain why.

On the one hand, the Fish language is a very well designed shell language that
much more resembles other languages without as many of the odd ways of writing
programs that you might find in Bash scripts. Sadly though, this results in Fish
programs being difficult to share with others. If I write a script in Fish and
share it with my coworkers, many of whom probably don't use Fish, then they
won't be able to use it. Additionally, many tutorials, StackOverflow answers, or
other online resources for shell scripting will not apply as they are more than
likely written in Bash rather than Fish.

I should also mention that I'm not saying this out of complete ignorance. I did
for a while really try to lean into writing scripts in Fish, but I was
constantly frustrated with having to recreate answers or other useful utilities
I found that it became far more work that it was worth. So, while I do like the
language from a theoretical standpoint, practically it doesn't do the job for
me.

## Conclusion

Shells help us get work done while in the terminal. Some use them more than
others, and most people who spend a lot of time in their terminal have some
strong opinions about the best shell to use. While I definitely not so tied to
Fish that I would spend hours debating that it is what you should use, I do find
it helpful for my workflow and would encourage you to give it a try if you
haven't tried it before!
