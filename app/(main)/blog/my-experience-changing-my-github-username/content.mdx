I created my GitHub account about 3 years ago while working at my first software
development job. At the time, Python was one of my primary languages for
personal projects and was the inspiration for my first StackOverflow and GitHub
username: `markypython`.

Since that time however, my usage of Python has decreased dramatically as I
moved into JavaScript and Node.js development. I also had begun to use the
username `mskelton` for most of my other accounts and the inconsistency annoyed
me. However, some initial research into changing my GitHub username got me
pretty frightened and I seriously questioned if it was worth it. Nevertheless,
the desire to change my username remained and I eventually decided to do it.

## Determining the Impact

The first important step in changing my username was determining what the impact
of changing it would be. While
[GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/changing-your-github-username)
provided some helpful information, I also found two articles by others who have
changed their GitHub username that provided good information about what could
break when you changing your username. I have linked those articles below.

- [A quick guide to changing your GitHub username](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-guide-to-changing-your-github-username/)
- [Changing my GitHub username](https://www.nikhita.dev/changing-my-github-username)

I was quite fortunate because I don't use GitHub pages, Netlify, or any other
service that uses a `username.github.io` url, so a number of the steps in those
articles did not apply to me. In the end, the changes I was

- Repository links in `package.json` and readme files.
- Changelogs or contribution links in repositories I've contributed to.
- VSCode and JetBrains extension links
- Travis CI
- Git config files

## Taking the Plunge

Once I was reasonably confident of the impact, I decided to take the plunge and
rename my account. I had already secured my new username and had created a
separate GitHub account for it while I prepared for the rename. Once I was ready
to go, I deleted the temporary account and then renamed my main account to the
new username. GitHub did its thing and within a minute it had successfully
changed my username. Hooray ðŸŽ‰

After renaming your username, the first step you should take is squatting your
old username. I'll explain more about this in the next section, but you'll want
to make sure that you do this immediately after renaming your account.

Once my account was renamed, I started updating my repos in order of most used
to least used. I maintain a JetBrains plugin and two VS Code plugins, so I
started with those so I could get a new patch release out with my updating
username. I use Travis CI for these plugins, and I found that you need to login
to your Travis account and click the sync account button in your account
settings for Travis to update to use your new username. Codecov was similar to
Travis CI, but I found that I needed to logout and then log back in for the
username change to be applied.

When making updates to your repos, take advantage of GitHub's search feature
which allows you to search all of GitHub for a piece of text. This was very
helpful in determining where my username was being used especially for repos
I've contributed to. I even found a repo I didn't know existed which was based
on one of my repos!

Updating my Git config files was fairly painless by running `grep` to find which
of my projects needed updating.

```bash
grep markypython */.git/config
```

After getting that list, I just did some VS Code multi-cursor editing to
generate a list of `sed` commands that looked like this. _This worked on macOS,
but if you use another Unix-based OS, your mileage may vary._

```bash
sed -i '' -e 's/markypython/mskelton/' dotfiles/.git/config
```

## Squatting Your Old Username

When you rename your account, GitHub will setup redirects from your old username
to your new username, but if someone takes over your new username and creates a
repo with the same name, those redirects will no longer go to your repository.
To prevent this, create a new account with your old username and clearly
identify that you renamed your main account.

An important note about squatting your old username is that GitHub prohibits
name squatting and holding names for future use in their
[username policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-username-policy).
Because of this policy, I would recommend squatting your old username for a
month or two and then deleting your old account so it is available for other
users in the future.

## Wrapping It Up

Aside from the decision to start the processing of renaming my account at 9:30
PM on a Friday night, I am very happy that I decided to rename my account as it
was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. The changes required are mostly
busy-work and don't require a huge amount of effort. I wish the best to anyone
else who embarks on the same journey of renaming their GitHub account and I hope
this article was helpful in explaining some of that process!
