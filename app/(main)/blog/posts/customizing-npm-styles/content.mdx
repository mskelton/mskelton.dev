import ImageComparison from '../../components/ImageComparison'

Like most front-end developers, I use [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) to
find new packages or read documentation for packages I use. I've also
published some npm packages of my own, giving back to the open-source
community.

As I have used [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) more in the past few months,
a couple of the styles used on the package view page were just bugging me
as they gave the page an unfinished and poorly styled look. So, with the
help of the Chrome Stylus extension I was able to add a couple quick styles
to get the page looking nice. The before and after of the page are shown
below.

<ImageComparison
  one={{ alt: 'New styles', src: 'new.png' }}
  two={{ alt: 'Old styles', src: 'old.png' }}
/>

Here is the code I used for this simple style adjustment.

```css showLineNumbers
blockquote > p {
  margin: 5px 0 !important;
}

table {
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}
```
