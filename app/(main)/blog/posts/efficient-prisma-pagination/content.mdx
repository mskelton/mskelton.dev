When adding pagination to the [Bytes](/bytes) section of my website, I didn't
want to use traditional limit/offset pagination, instead I wanted to experiment
with cursor based pagination which scales significantly better than limit/offset
pagination.

One of the challenges with cursor based pagination is knowing the pagination
boundaries. For example, when are you at the last page? Or, if navigating back
towards the beginning, how do you know when you reach the beginning? With a
little creativity we can solve this problem very efficient even with a
significant number of database records.

## Representing state in the URL

First, let's review the way we will store the state of the current page in the
URL query string. If there are no query params, we will default to the first
page of results. If there is an `after=<id>` query param, we will fetch the next
page of results following the `id` specified.

```
/bytes?after=20230920211722
```

When paginating backwards, we swap the `after` param with a `before` param.

```
/bytes?before=20230920211722
```

## The search query

There are two main challenges we have to solve to make the pagination work: the
query itself, and managing when to enable/disable the previous/next links. Let's
start with the query which should look something like this.

```ts hi showLineNumbers
type Direction = "none" | "forward" | "backward"

function searchBytes({ before, after }: { before?: string; after?: string }) {
  const direction: Direction = after ? "forward" : before ? "backward" : "none"
  const cursor = after ?? before

  const res = await prisma.byte.findMany({
    cursor: cursor ? { id: cursor } : undefined,
    skip: direction === "none" ? undefined : 1,
    take: (direction === "backward" ? -1 : 1) * (PAGE_SIZE + 1),
  })
}
```

There are three search "directions" that are possible. The default is `none`
indicating we are on the root page without having ever paginated through
results. In this case, we don't want to skip any items, and we pull one more
than the page size. More on that in a moment.

The next direction is `forward`, which functionally is very similar to `none`,
with the slight difference being that we need to skip an item.

```typescript showLineNumbers {3}
const res = await prisma.byte.findMany({
  cursor: cursor ? { id: cursor } : undefined,
  skip: direction === "none" ? undefined : 1,
  take: (direction === "backward" ? -1 : 1) * (PAGE_SIZE + 1),
})
```

This is due to the fact that when we navigate to a URL like this:

```
/bytes?after=20230920211722
```

We are indicating we want to get a page of results after the item with the id of
`20230920211722`. Later when we build the previous/next links, we'll use the
last item in the page of results to make our link. As a result, we don't want
the query to return the last item of the previous page on the next page, since
we've already seen that item. So, applying `skip: 1` will ensure we skip to the
first item after the given id, just as the query string would imply.

The other important argument is `take`, which specifies the number of records to
return from the database query. As you can see we are taking one more record
than the page size, which we will need in the next section, so more on that in
just a moment.

```typescript showLineNumbers {4}
const res = await prisma.byte.findMany({
  cursor: cursor ? { id: cursor } : undefined,
  skip: direction === "none" ? undefined : 1,
  take: (direction === "backward" ? -1 : 1) * (PAGE_SIZE + 1),
})
```

When the `before` param is passed, this logic is very similar with the slight
exception that we are using a negative value for `take` which indicates we need
to get records before the specified cursor.

## Previous/next links

Now comes the fun part, generating previous/next links. If we are on the first
or the last page, we want to disable our previous/next buttons since we never
want a user navigating past the first or last item. This is typically quite easy
with limit/offset pagination since you pull the total count which you can use to
calculate if there are more items before or after the current page.

However, cursor based pagination makes this a tad more tricky. Even if we pull
the total count, that doesn't really help us since we don't know the index of
the current page of items, we just know they come before or after a given id.
This is where our one extra item comes into play.

First though, we need to trim the extra item from the array of results. We can
do this using `slice()` to either remove from the start or end of the array.

```typescript
const bytes =
  direction === "backward" ? res.slice(0, PAGE_SIZE) : res.slice(-PAGE_SIZE)
```

Okay, it's finally time to use that extra result that we've been talking about.
While it's not going to be displayed, we'll go ahead and check to see if the
number of items from the database is greater than the page size. If it was, then
we know there are more items. We don't know how many, but that doesn't matter,
we only care there is _some_ number of results we haven't yet seen.

```typescript
const hasMore = res.length > PAGE_SIZE
```

This helps, but we also can make a few assumptions about our data without
needing any information at all:

- When no `before`/`after` params are specified, we are on the first page, thus
  there is **no** previous page.
- When navigating forwards, there will **always** be a previous page.
- When navigating backwards, there will **always** be a next page.

Armed with this information, the logic for determining the next/previous page
links becomes fairly simple.

```typescript showLineNumbers {2,7}
const nextHref =
  direction === "backward" || hasMore
    ? `/bytes?after=${bytes.at(-1)?.id}`
    : undefined

const prevHref =
  direction === "forward" || (direction === "backward" && hasMore)
    ? `/bytes?before=${bytes.at(0)?.id}`
    : undefined
```

## Conclusion

So, it's fair to say that using cursor-based pagination is definitely overkill
for a simple site like mine, but the learning experience was definitely worth
it. In a production system where there is extremely high volumes of data, this
strategy is very effective for providing a rich pagination experience without
sacrificing performance.

It's also helpful to note that using cursor based pagination produces more
consistent results. Navigating to `/bytes?after=20230920211722` will always
return the same set of results assuming stable sorting, but `/bytes?page=2` will
produce different results as content is added or removed.
