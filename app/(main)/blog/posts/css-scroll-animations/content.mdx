In a recent project at work, I started exploring CSS scroll-driven
animations to transition elements in a sticky header between a larger and
smaller size. After just a couple hours of exploration I had a working
prototype using scroll animations to replace the much less reliable and
smooth JavaScript based animation.

Having just scratched the surface of what is possible with scroll-driven
animations, I knew a blog post was in order to show off some of the
incredible features of scroll-driven animations.

## What are animation timelines?

Before diving into scroll-driven animations, we first need to understand
what
[animation timelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline)
are. Historically, the only animation timeline that existed was the
[document timeline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentTimeline)
which will start incrementing when the page loads. As long as the page
remains open, the document timeline will continue to increment. We can
observe this by logging the `document.timeline` variable in our console.

```javascript
console.log(document.timeline) // { currentTime: 62199.911, duration: null }
```

When you apply animations to elements, they use the document timeline to
track the progress of the animation including any delays before starting
the animation, and then the duration of the animation itself.

Because scroll-driven animations are based on scroll progress and not time
durations, the document timeline doesn't make sense when starting to think
about animating elements based on scroll position. This is why
scroll-driven animations introduced the `animation-timeline` property which
allows us to target two new types of animation timelines that will be used
to create scroll-driven animations.

## Using the Scroll Timeline

Enough talk, let's see an example! We'll start with a rather simple example
showing a blue box that rotates as it's container scrolls. Try scrolling
the container below to see it rotate!

<Demo tight>
  <BasicScroll />
</Demo>

Let's take a look at the code for this simple animation. The HTML structure
is quite simple, just three nested `div`s.

```html
<div className="container">
  <div className="scroll-area">
    <div className="box" />
  </div>
</div>
```

For the CSS, we have some fairly typical code to define a set of keyframes
for our animation, set up our container and scroll area, and then style and
position our box in the center of the container. The highlighted lines are
certainly the most interesting, as that's where we define our animation.

```css {20-21}
@keyframes spin {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}

.container {
  height: 480px;
  overflow-y: scroll;
}

.scroll-area {
  height: 1200px;
}

.box {
  animation: spin linear;
  animation-timeline: scroll();
  aspect-ratio: 1;
  left: calc(50% - 60px);
  position: relative;
  top: calc(50% - 60px);
  width: 120px;
}
```

We specify the animation just like we would with any other CSS animation by
referencing our set of keyframes (`spin`), and an easing function
(`linear`). You may noticed that we haven't added an animation duration,
which again makes sense since our animation is tied to scroll progress
rather than a time-duration. Finally, the most important part is specifying
`animation-timeline: scroll()` which tells the browser that our animation
should be based on the scroll progress of the nearest scroll ancestor.

Just like that, we've built our first scroll-driven animation!

> [!ERROR Firefox bug]  
> To make this work properly in Firefox, we need to add
> `animation-duration: 1ms` to our styles. The exact value value doesn't
> actually matter, but Firefox needs the property for the animation to

> animations continues to improve.

## More use cases for the scroll timeline

That previous example was fun, but it's not all that useful to just make a
box spin as the user scrolls down the page. There are plenty of use cases
though where you might want to create animations using the scroll timeline,
such as:

- Adding a reading progress indicator for a blog post.
- Applying a shadow or similar styling to a sticky header as you begin to
  scroll.
- Slide in a newsletter reminder when the user scrolls half way down the
  page.

Let's go ahead and implement that second idea of adding styling to a sticky
header as you scroll the page. Before we see how this works with scroll
animations, let's first take a look at the kind of code you might think of
for a task like this.

```javascript
let [isScrolled, setIsScrolled] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  function onScroll() {
    setIsScrolled(window.scrollY > 0)
  }

  onScroll()
  window.addEventListener("scroll", onScroll, { passive: true })
  return () =>
    window.removeEventListener("scroll", onScroll, { passive: true })
}, [])

return <header className={isScrolled ? "shadow-lg" : ""}></header>
```

In the code above, we are using some state to track whether the window has
been scrolled so we can conditionally apply styles. Those styles might be a
shadow like shown above, or perhaps shrinking an image to a smaller size.
Regardless of the specifics, that's how it might look.

With scroll-driven animations, we can get a bit fancier. Try scrolling the
container below to see how the header background color slowly fades in as
your scroll the container.

<Demo tight>
  <HeaderFade />
</Demo>

The HTML is once again very simple, just a container `div` that holds our
header and the main content of the page.

```html
<div class="container">
  <header>Lorem AI</header>
  <main>...</main>
</div>
```

The CSS is very similar to our first example containing some keyframes,
making our container scrollable, and some animation properties for our
header.

```css {19-21}
@keyframes header {
  from {
    backdrop-filter: blur(0);
    background: transparent;
  }
  to {
    backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
    background: rgb(30 41 59 / 0.75);
  }
}

.container {
  height: 320px;
  overflow-y: scroll;
  position: relative;
}

header {
  animation: header linear forwards;
  animation-timline: scroll();
  animation-range: 0 80px;
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
}
```

There are a couple differences with the animation declaration from our last
example, most prominently being the new `animation-range` keyword. This
instructs the browser the start and end scroll positions to use as the
start and end of the animation timeline. If not specified, this would be
the start and end of our scroll container, but by specifying a range of
`0 80px`, the browser will start the animation immediately after starting
to scroll our container, and finish when the user has scrolled 80px.

With the addition of `animation-range`, we also need to specify an
`animation-fill-mode` which is what we've done with the `forwards` keyword
in the `animation` property. This ensures that once we've scrolled past
80px in the container, the element will retain the values from the last
keyframe in the animation, which in our case is the background color and
blur effect. If we don't specify this property, our element will reset back
to it's initial values before the animation took place which is not the
intended behavior.

## Using the View Timeline

<Demo tight>
  <ImagePop />
</Demo>

The HTML is again fairly simple, a container with some paragraphs and an
image.

```html
<div class="container">
  <p>...</p>
  <img />
  <p>...</p>
</div>
```

The CSS will also look quite similar to the example previously with the
`scroll()` timeline, except in this case we are using the `view()`
timeline. The view timeline starts when the element enters the viewport,
and ends when the element leaves the viewport.

By adjusting the `animation-range`, we are able to adjust how quickly the
animation completes. Using the value of `0 50%`, the image will be fully
animated in when 50% of it is in the viewport. This could be adjusted
higher or lower based on your use case, but a value between 30-50 is a good
starting point to provide some visual flair, without harming the user
experience.

```css {18-20}
@keyframes pop {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scaleX(90%);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scaleX(100%);
  }
}

.container {
  height: 400px;
  overflow: none scroll;
}

img {
  animation: pop linear;
  animation-range: 0 50%;
  animation-timeline: view();
}
```
