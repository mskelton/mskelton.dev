Real-time applications have always fascinated me. The idea that you can connect
people from all over the world in a single web application to chat, edit files,
or play games with near instant feedback is simply amazing. Having very little
experience with what goes into building real-time applications I was interesting
in re-building a key feature of collaboration within Figma: multiplayer cursors.
