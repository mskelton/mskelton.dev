A couple weeks ago, my fellow front-end developers at
[Widen](https://www.widen.com) had a conversation regarding one of our shared
React components which we were struggling to implement in one of our
applications. While most React components are fully controlled (via props) or
fully uncontrolled (internal state), this component used what is known as
"derived state" which is internal state that is controlled to some degree by
props. Although derived state might seem like a good solution, it often causes
many more problems than it attempts to solve.

My goal in this article is not to convince you that derived state should be
avoided. React has an excellent
[article on derived state](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html)
which does a great job of explaining why derived state is an anti-pattern. The
focus of this article will be about how to recognize derived state in your
components and several alternatives to derived state.

## Recognizing derived state

Before I go any further, let me provide a few examples of derived state to help
you start recognizing derived state patterns. I'll begin with class based
components as they are easier to recognize than function based components.

```javascript showLineNumbers
class PartiallyControlledInput extends React.Component {
  state = {
    value: this.props.value,
  }

  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    if (nextProps.value !== this.props.value) {
      this.setState({ value: nextProps.value })
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <input
        onChange={(e) => this.setState({ value: e.target.value })}
        value={this.state.value}
      />
    )
  }
}
```

In this example, we have a component which is a partially controlled input
field. The component manages its state internally but it also allows the parent
component to update the state by changing the `value` prop. The key part of this
example is `componentWillReceiveProps` which is the red flag indicating the
component derives its state from props.

Because `componentWillReceiveProps` is being deprecated, React has a newer
lifecycle method named `getDerivedStateFromProps`. This method almost needs no
example as its name speaks for itself, but a quick example won't hurt.

```javascript showLineNumbers
class PartiallyControlledInput extends React.Component {
  state = {
    value: this.props.value,
    prevFormId: this.props.formId,
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    if (props.formId !== state.prevFormId) {
      return {
        prevFormId: props.formId,
        value: props.value,
      }
    }

    return null
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <input
        onChange={(e) => this.setState({ value: e.target.value })}
        value={this.state.value}
      />
    )
  }
}
```

As you can see, `getDerivedStateFromProps` gets even more complex as we are
required to store a prop value in state so when that prop changes we can reset
state based on props.

As we move on to function based components, derived state is a bit tougher to
spot as you have to look for more than just `componentWillReceiveProps` or
`getDerivedStateFromProps`.

```javascript showLineNumbers
function PartiallyControlledInput(props) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(props.value)

  useEffect(() => {
    setValue(props.value)
  }, [props.value])

  return <input onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} value={value} />
}
```

As you can see, the previous example is a more subtle use of derived state. When
`props.value` changes, an effect will run which will set the value of the input
with the new prop value. This is essentially the same as the first example we
showed above and suffers from the exact same problems. Just because it is
written with hooks doesn't mean it is magically better than its class based
equivalent!

## Alternatives to derived state

Now that we've seen a few examples of derived state, let's look at some
alternative solutions.

### Fully uncontrolled component with a key

The first option would be to make the component fully uncontrolled and use
React's special `key` prop which will create a new instance of the component
rather than updating the existing one. This includes re-initializing component
state with the initial values provided.

```javascript showLineNumbers
function FullyUncontrolledInput({ initialValue }) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue)

  return <input onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} value={value} />
}
```

To use the component, we simply need to provide an initialValue prop as well as
a `key` prop. To re-initialize the internal state of the input, we simply need
to change the `key`. In the following code block, we use a variable named
`formId` which we can change when the form needs to be reset.

```javascript showLineNumbers
function Form() {
  return <FullyUncontrolledInput key={formId} initialValue="Initial" />
}
```

Fully controlled component The next option is to make the input fully controlled
and let the parent component manage its state. This option will require us to
add an `onChange` prop to the input component so the parent can listen to
changes and update state accordingly.

```javascript showLineNumbers
function FullyControlledInput({ value, onChange }) {
  return <input onChange={(e) => onChange(e.target.value)} value={value} />
}
```

With our fully controlled input component, we now can add a simple `useState`
hook to our form component which will manage the state of our input.

```javascript showLineNumbers
function Form() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("Initial")

  return <FullyControlledInput onChange={setValue} value={value} />
}
```

### Custom hooks!

While the previous examples sound like easy solutions, many real-world
components are much more complex than those simple examples. In these
situations, creating a custom hook might just be what you need to achieve a high
level of customization without large boilerplate.

For example, consider a date picker component which accepts props for the
currently selected day and month as well as event handlers when the user changes
the day or month. Rather than making our form component manage all the state and
event handlers, we can wrap that logic in a custom `useDatePicker` hook!

```javascript showLineNumbers
function useDatePicker(initialValues = { day: 1, month: "Jan" }) {
  const [month, setMonth] = useState(initialValues.month)
  const [day, setDay] = useState(initialValues.day)

  return {
    datePickerProps: {
      day,
      month,
      onDayChange: setDay,
      onMonthChange: setMonth,
    },
    day,
    month,
    setDay,
    setMonth,
  }
}
```

Now, we can very easily call the `useDatePicker` hook inside our form component
and pass `datePickerProps` to the date picker component which will add all the
necessary props for managing the state of the component.

```javascript showLineNumbers
function Form() {
  const { datePickerProps, day, month } = useDatePicker()

  useEffect(() => {
    // Do something when day or month changes
  }, [day, month])

  return <DatePicker {...datePickerProps} theme="dark" />
}
```

Because the hook isn't directly tied to the component, we can achieve a high
level of customization. For example, if we want to trigger some side effect when
the day changes, we can simply add a `useEffect` hook with a dependency on the
`day` variable. Or, if we needed to customize the `onDayChange` logic, we could
override the prop returned in `datePickerProps` with a custom `onDayChange`
prop. We could even create a reset button in the form component which when
clicked uses the `setDay` and `setMonth` functions to reset the date picker to
the current day. The possibilities are endless, so use your imagination and come
up with something great!
