In a recent project at work, I started exploring CSS scroll animations to
transition elements in a sticky header between a larger and smaller size. After
just a couple hours of exploration I had a working prototype using scroll
animations to replace the much less reliable and smooth JavaScript based
animation.

Having just scratched the surface of what is possible with scroll animations, I
knew a blog post was in order to show off some of the incredible features of
scroll animations.

Let's start with a rather simple example showing a blue box that rotates as it's
container scrolls. Try scrolling the container below to see it rotate!

<Demo>
  <BasicScroll />
</Demo>

To accomplish this lovely animation, we only need to add 3 lines of CSS.

<CodeBlock filename="BasicScroll.css" meta="[28-30]" />

We specify the `animation` just like we would with any other CSS animation by
referencing a set of keyframes (e.g. `rotate`), and an easing function (e.g.
`linear`). What is missing from our `animation` property is a duration which is
required when using standard CSS animations. This is omitted because a duration
does not make sense when the animation is linked to scroll progress.
