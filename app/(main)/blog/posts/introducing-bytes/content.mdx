Today, I'm very proud to unveil [Bytes](/bytes), my collection of
short-form posts, tips, and things I learn as I build software! I'm super
excited about this new section of my website both from a technical
standpoint as it was a great deal of fun to build, but I'm more excited
about being able to use Bytes to more frequently share small snippets of
useful information with you all. To kick of this launch, I wanted to write
up in a bit more detail both the inspiration and reason for building Bytes,
but also how I built it to make it extremely easy to maintain.

## What is Bytes?

The idea of Bytes is short blog posts that can be written in around 3-5
minutes. Typically blog posts take a lot more time to write as they tend to
dive more deeply into a particular topic and explain it in depth. Bytes on
the other hand intends to document and share **small learning moments** I
have throughout the day. This might include such topics as:

- Shell scripts I build to simplify workflows
- Vim/Neovim tips and tricks
- Lesser known JavaScript APIs or CSS features
- How to use Git more effectively
- And much more!

## Small learning moments

The idea of small learning moments is part of my overall philosophy on how
to improve as a software engineer. Many software engineers will face the
same challenges over and over again because they do not take the time to
improve their workflow in small ways, each and every day. Instead of
assigning a keyboard shortcut to that command you run several times a day
in VS Code, you keep opening up the command palette, searching for the
command, and running it manually. You keep typing the same boilerplate for
a unit test instead of building a snippet to add it with a few keystrokes.

These moments are critically important to improving your developer workflow
and recognizing them is the first step in the process. One thing I've seen
happen very consistently with junior and mid level engineers is that they
want to improve and become more efficient, but they often don't know where
to start. I understand that feeling, we've all been there! It feels quite
daunting when you see other engineers who are highly productive and you
wonder, "how will I ever" become that good?

The truth of the matter is taking advantage of small moments consistently
is one of the keys to success in software engineering. There is **so** much
more I would love to say about this, but it's best left to a dedicated post
I plan on writing in the future. For now, let's move on and talk a bit more
about Bytes, and how I built it!

## The tech stack

My website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) using the
[App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)
that was introduced in Next.js 13. I love the simplicity that React Server
Components brings apps like my website where you can do data fetching
directly in your components and let Next.js deal with all the hard stuff.
Not having to worry about API endpoints, data fetching libraries, and
caching makes development feel like a dream.

For the majority of my website's content, I use MDX with a fair number of
plugins, some pre-built and some custom plugins to make it super simple to
author content for my website. As I was planning on Bytes, I had three main
goals.

1. Make it effortless to create new bytes in a matter of minutes.
1. Publish new Bytes without redeploying the entire site.
1. Make it easy to search through what will become a fairly large
   collection of content.

With these goals in mind, I decided that it would make the most sense to
host the content for bytes in a separate repo. These files get indexed into
a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) database (backed by
[Turso](https://turso.tech)) which makes it very simple to search and
reduces the dependency on using the GitHub API for requests. Not to mention
that searching through raw files on GitHub is kind of tricky if you want to
build any kind of search experience.

Now with the contents of the [bytes](https://github.com/mskelton/bytes)
repo being indexed to the website, I then setup a webhook so that new
commits pushed to the would be sent to the website. The website takes these
commits, and based on what files were added, removed, or modified, updates
the database accordingly fetching the latest data from GitHub. This worked
great, and gives me basically immediate publishing anytime I push content
to the bytes repo.

I thought about doing this in the main website repo and just ignoring
specific paths from builds, but I worried that doing so would make it
difficult to add or update bytes if I'm simultaneously working on a branch
that is not yet ready to push. This is part of that first goal of making it
effortless to add bytes, I don't want to think about switching branches,
merge conflicts, or any similar nonsense. Just let me push content and let
it just work.

The last piece of this all is not yet finished, but I'm working on building
a simple Go CLI tool that will allow me to add bytes directly in the
command line. Basically it will create a temporary file for you to add the
content, then once you save and exit your editor (in my case Neovim), it
will automatically push that byte to the bytes repo which will trigger the
webhook.

The beauty of this setup is that even without this CLI tool, I can still
add bytes since I'm just committing files to a GitHub repo. Plus, I don't
need to worry about database backups or anything, if for some reason I nuke
the database I can just run my `pnpm db:reindex` script which will pull all
the content fresh from the bytes repo and add it to the database.

## More to come

I'm super excited to launch bytes today and start this journey with you
all! While there are only a few bytes published so far, expect many more to
come in the coming days and weeks. I'm also hoping this will help me to be
more active in content writing that I can get a few other longer blog posts
out the door that I've been chewing on for a while. Cheers!
