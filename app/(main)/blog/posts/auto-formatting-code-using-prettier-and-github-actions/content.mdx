title: Auto Formatting Code Using Prettier and GitHub Actions
description:
  Enforcing consistent code formatting in your repositories with Prettier
  is great, but it can easily result in a less than ideal developer
  experience. In this article, I discuss how to leverage GitHub Actions to
  automate code formatting without requiring any additional steps from
  developers.

Prettier is a very popular code formatter which uses very opinionated but
sensible styles to format your code and prevent the ongoing debates about
code styles. When implementing Prettier into a project, the typical
approach is to setup a pre-commit hook using a tool such as
[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) which will run
Prettier on your staged files prior to committing. While this works well in
most cases, there are a number of challenges with this approach.

1. Non-staged files are not formatted. When changes are made to Prettier
   configuration or Prettier is updated, untouched files will not be
   formatted unless you manually run Prettier.
1. Pre-commit steps can be skipped. Running `git commit --no-verify` will
   commit code without running pre-commit hooks which can result in files
   not being formatted.
1. Pre-commit steps are slow. Running tasks like Prettier during pre-commit
   adds additional time when committing files due to Prettier having to
   format each file that is staged.

## Finding a better way

Recently, a few of my coworkers implemented a tool called
[Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) into a number of projects
to automatically format Java code in our CI pipeline. I was quite intrigued
by the concept of automatically formatting code in CI that I pondered if a
similar process could be done using Prettier and GitHub Actions for
JavaScript projects. _Spoiler alert, it works!_

After a few Google searches, I came across
[GitHub Prettier Action](https://github.com/creyD/prettier_action) which
formats your code using Prettier and commits any changes files when
finished. While this looked like it would be the solution, it doesn't use
the version of Prettier specified in your dependencies meaning that local
formatting changes applied by your editor or by running Prettier manually
could get changed by the CI build if the versions differed. While this
could be resolved by always keeping the version of Prettier in your npm
dependencies and the GitHub action in sync, this adds extra work that needs
to be done when updating dependencies.

So, while the Prettier Action is not the best solution, there is another
solution that is just as easy to implement! This solution utilizes the
[git-auto-commit-action](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action)
alongside whatever formatting script you have in your repository. For
example, my repository has the following script to format using Prettier.

```json showLineNumbers package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  }
}
```

To setup the GitHub action, all we need to do is install our dependencies
(e.g. `npm ci`), run our format script (e.g. `npm run format`), and then
commit any changes if necessary.

```yaml showLineNumbers .github/workflows/format.yml
name: Format
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  format:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "16.x"
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run format
      - name: Commit changes
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          commit_message: Apply formatting changes
          branch: ${{ github.head_ref }}
```

## Conclusion

By utilizing GitHub Actions for automatically formatting with Prettier, we
were able to eliminate all three issues described at the beginning of this
article. While the example I showed only performed formatting with
Prettier, you could also run ESLint, stylelint, or any other formatting
tool you use as part of the GitHub action!
