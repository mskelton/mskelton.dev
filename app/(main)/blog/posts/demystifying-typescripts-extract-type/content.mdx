Many of the applications I develop at work utilize TypeScript for front-end
development to provide a high level of type safety while also remaining
familiar to developers who are used to JavaScript. In one such application,
a need arose that required a more sophisticated type than I use on a daily
basis. After some research, I discovered a solution using TypeScript's
`Extract` type. In this post, I'll share a few examples of how you can use
`Extract` in your own projects to improve type safety and developer
experience.

## Use case: Extracting subsets of a union

To get started with `Extract`, let's look at a simple example. Suppose we
have a type `MixedArgs`, which is a union type containing four different
members of various types. Our goal is to "extract" the members of the union
that are functions, which we can do using `Extract`. This would look
something like this:

```typescript
type MixedArgs = string | number | () => string | () => number
type FunctionArgs = Extract<MixedArgs, Function>
```

The first argument we pass to Extract is our union type and the second
argument is the type that we will use when comparing each member of the
union. If a member is assignable to our second argument, it will be
included in the resulting type.

_Pro tip: The second argument to `Extract` can also be a union!_

Since `string` and `number` are not assignable to `Function,` they will not
be included in the resulting type. This results in `FunctionArgs`
evaluating to the following type:

```typescript
type FunctionArgs = () => string | () => number
```

## Use case: `filterProducts`

Now that we understand the basic concept, let's look at a real world
example. Say we have an array of products, each of which contains a key
`type` which is a string to determine what type of object it is. This would
look something like this:

```typescript
type Product =
  | { type: "book"; author: string }
  | { type: "movie"; producer: string }
  | { type: "appliance"; manufacturer: string }
```

Let's say we want to create a function that takes an array of `Product`s
and returns only those which match a specified type. This would look
something like this:

```typescript
function filterProducts(products: Product[], type: Product["type"]) {
  return products.filter((item) => item.type === type)
}
```

While this function will do exactly what we want at runtime, the type
returned from calling `filterProducts(products, 'book')` will be
`Product[]` even though we know that the resulting array won't contain any
`movie`s or `appliance`s. With the power of `Extract`, we can improve this:

```typescript
function filterProducts<T extends Product, U extends T["type"]>(
  products: T[],
  type: U,
) {
  return products.filter(
    (item): item is Extract<T, Record<"type", U>> => item.type === type,
  )
}
```

There is a lot going on here, so let's break it down. First, we've updated
the function to accept two generic arguments: `T` and `U`. TypeScript will
infer the value of these
[generic arguments](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html#generic-constraints)
since we have typed the function parameters using the generic variables.
Since each generic argument has a corresponding generic constraint, the
function will properly type check the arguments provided to the function
like it did in the non-generic example we looked at before.

Now that we have our generic arguments, we can add a
[type predicate](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates)
to our filter function. Our type predicate allows us to instruct TypeScript
about the specific type of the argument passed to the function when the
function returns `true`. `Array.prototype.filter` will use this to narrow
the type of the resulting array.

The type that our type predicate is narrowing to is
`Extract<T, Record<"type", U>>`, which probably looks a bit confusing at
first. The type we are extracting from is `T`, which will be our array of
Products that we passed to our function. `Record<"type", U>` will be an
object that looks something like this: `{ type: 'book' }`. Just like our
previous example with `FunctionArgs`, `Extract` will return a type
containing all members that `{ type: 'book' }` is assignable to. Our final
resulting type when calling our function will look like this:

```typescript
type Result = { type: "book"; author: string }[]
```

Neat, right!

## Bonus: Extract with template literal types

For a little bonus, let's explore a complex but extremely powerful way of
using Extract with
[template literal types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html)
to extract keys from an object with keys matching a specific pattern.

Let's say we have a `Person` type that contains some details about the
user.

```typescript
type Person = {
  name: string
  email: string
  homePhone: number
  mobilePhone: number
  workPhone: number
}
```

Now, further suppose that we want to create a type from `Person` that
contains only the phone number keys. This would be fairly simple with
`Pick` as we could do this:

```typescript
type PhoneInfo = Pick<Person, "homePhone" | "mobilePhone" | "workPhone">
```

However, if we have a large number of phone number keys, this will be
difficult to maintain and prone to errors. With `Extract` and template
literal types we can create the `PhoneInfo` type very easily with the
following code:

```typescript
type PhoneInfo = {
  [key in Extract<keyof Person, `${string}Phone`>]: Person[key]
}
```

The resulting type of `PhoneInfo` is the following:

```typescript
type PhoneInfo = {
  homePhone: number
  mobilePhone: number
  workPhone: number
}
```

I don't know about you, but the power of type constructs like this is one
of the reasons I love TypeScript!
