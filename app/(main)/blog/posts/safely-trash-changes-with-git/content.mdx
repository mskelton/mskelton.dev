`git trash` is an alias I've been using for a long time to remove any
staged and unstaged changes in the current repository and reset to a clean
state. This is very useful when experimenting with some throw away code
that you won't need anymore. However, after several times of accidentally
running this command with some changes I actually wanted to keep, it was
time for some changes.

My original version of `git trash` was the following which reverts all
changes to tracked files and deletes any untracked files.

```toml ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
  trash = !git reset --hard && git clean -fd
```

The problem with this approach, is the changes are gone for good when you
run it. There is no way to recover them if you run `git trash`
accidentally. A solution to this problem is surprisingly simple: just
commit and revert the changes.

Because the goal of `git trash` is to just delete changes without
committing them, running `git commit` followed by `git revert` isn't a
solution since I don't want to end up with that in the history of the
branch. Instead, you can commit and then reset the commit which will remove
the commit from history. But, while the commit is no longer present in the
branch history, it still exists in the
[reflog](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog). which can be used to recover
the trashed changes.

```bash
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
  git add -A
  git commit -qm 'trashing'
  git reset -q --hard HEAD~1
else
  echo 'No changes to discard'
  exit 1
fi
```

Since I wanted to keep the `git trash` alias, I rewrote the above script as
a very gross looking inline function:

```toml ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
  trash = "!f() { if [ -n \"$(git status --porcelain)\" ]; then git add -A && git commit -qm 'trashing' && git reset -q --hard HEAD~1; else echo 'No changes to discard'; exit 1; fi; }; f"
```

With this setup, it's time to start trashing some code!

```bash
echo "I'm going to be trashed" >test.txt
git trash
git show 'HEAD@{1}'
```

After running these commands, the repo should be in a clean state, but the
commit details printed by running `git show` will show that the trashed
changes still exist in the reflog.

```diff
commit 2e3f57a1
Author: Mark Skelton
Date:   Mon Nov 4 17:26:02 2024 -0600

    trashing

diff --git a/test.txt b/test.txt
new file mode 100644
index 00000000..7639cf5a
--- /dev/null
+++ b/test.txt
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+I'm going to be trashed
```

Running `git reflog` makes it easier to see what's going on here:

```
96beb357 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
2e3f57a1 HEAD@{1}: commit: trashing
96beb357 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) HEAD@{2}: commit: Write blog post
```

In both the `git show` and `git reflog` commands the commit sha of
`2e3f57a1` is printed which can be used to recover the trashed changes:

```bash
git checkout 2e3f57a1
```

After checkout out the commit, all the changes you trashed will be
restored. At this point it's as simple as committing any or all of the
trashed changes to a branch to then continue working on them from there.
