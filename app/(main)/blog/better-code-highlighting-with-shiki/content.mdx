title: Better Code Highlighting with Shiki
description:
  Maintaining a developer blog almost always includes code highlighting. I
  recently switched from Prism to Shiki for more accurate and familiar code
  highlighting.

I've used Prism for code highlighting in many projects, but I've never been very
happy with the results as it usually struggles to properly detect syntax,
especially with uncommon languages, or with JSX. As I was scrolling through
Twitter the other day, I saw some mention about a project called
[Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki), which uses TextMate grammars and VS
Code themes to perform syntax highlighting. This seemed like a great solution
for code highlighting, so I decided to give it a try.

After a very simple process of installing shiki as well as the
[rehype-shiki](https://github.com/stefanprobst/rehype-shiki) plugin, I was able
to convert my blog to using shiki without any major gotchas! Check out the
before/after image below to see the difference shiki makes in properly
highlighting code!

<ImageComparison
  one={{ alt: "New syntax highlighting", src: "new.png" }}
  two={{ alt: "Old syntax highlighting", src: "old.png" }}
/>
