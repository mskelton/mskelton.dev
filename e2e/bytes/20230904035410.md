title: Better Shell Aliases
tags: [fish, cli]

I use shell aliases quite heavily to simplify common CLI commands. However,
one of my biggest pain points when using them is they didn't work as well
in certain complex commands.

For example, suppose I have the following alias in my Fish config that
assigns the `task` command to an alias `t`:

```bash
alias t="task"
```

Now I can run commands like this:

```bash
t add New task
```

But with a complex command like this, it doesn't work:

```fish
seq 10 | xargs -I {} t add Testing {}
```

I found that a simple solution was to simple create a binary in addition to
the alias. For the `t` alias, this would look like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

task "$@"
```

Now, you could just create the binary and remove the alias, but the alias
ensures fish can provide autocompletion properly, so I find that the
combination of both gives the best of both worlds.
