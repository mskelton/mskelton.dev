title: Using Git Hooks When Creating Worktrees
tags: [git]
---

I've started to use `git worktree`s more lately but one of the pain points I had
was that they don't copied ignored files such as `.env` files. I found I was
able to improve this workflow by adding a `post-checkout` hook.

In a nutshell, the hook will check if we are checking out a new worktree (that's
what the `"$1" == "0000..."` is all about). If we are, then we can run some code
to copy over whatever files we need to.

```bash showLineNumbers .git/hooks/post-checkout
#!/bin/bash

if [[ "$1" == "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" ]]; then
	basePath="$HOME/dev/repo"
	paths=(.env)

	for path in "${paths[@]}"; do
		cp "$basePath/$path" "$(pwd)/$path"
	done
fi
```
